    Hi, I am Devi! ‚ú®
    
    Passionate about effective communication from a young age, on my completing my undergrad, I joined a multinational IT firm's program management group, improving technical documents across the SDLC, as a technical writer. Seeking growth, I pursued a Master's in IT Management in the US. With experience in market research at Research Now, project portfolio management at Deloitte, and cross-functional leadership at Microsoft, I thrive in diverse domains.

    Both at life and work, I always strive to see the big picture and embrace challenges as opportunities. As a strategic problem-solver, I possess core skill of project management, emotional intelligence and being comfortable with conflict. I bring enthusiasm, purpose, and a 'roll-up-your-sleeves' attitude to every task and project I've delivered . Being purpose driven, I'm always on the lookout to make a positive difference in people's lives.
